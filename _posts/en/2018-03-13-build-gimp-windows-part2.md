If you are not very familiar with building programs from the command line, the first part might seem a bit complicated for you. Luckily we can automate most of the needed commands so that we only have to press a single button to start compiling.

In this part we will integrate the build environment from part 1 into Visual Studio Code. This will 
allow you to edit Gimp's source code, compile and debug the result - all from within VS Code.
